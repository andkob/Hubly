## ðŸš§ Getting Started
***Note:** This project is currently in development (many security vulnerabilities have not yet been addressed). Please follow the instructions below only if you are interested in building on it or trying out the existing features.*

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 21
- Maven
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andkob/Planly.git
cd Planly
```
2. Configure JWT Secret
*This is a temporary solution for development only*
* If you're on Linux or macOS, you can generate a random secret key with the following command:
    ```bash
    $ openssl rand -base64 32
    ```
    Or if you're on Windows, you can use the provided powershell script located in the root directory:
    ```bash
    $ powershell -File jwt-secret-generator.ps1
    ```
* Copy the generated secret and hardcode it into the **application.properties** file (located in resources)
```properties
jwt.secret=YourSuperSecretKeyThatIsHardToGuess
```
3. Build and Run Backend
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
4. Install and Run the React Development Server
```bash
cd src/main/webapp/frontend
npm install
npm start
```
5. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

## ðŸ”œ Upcoming Features
- Google OAuth 2.0 integration
- Google Calendar synchronization
- Enhanced event management tools
- Mobile application
