### Some key points about this code

1. It uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication with Google's APIs
2. It reads from a Google Sheet specified by ID
3. It returns the data as a JSON response that your frontend can consume

### Next steps after getting this working:

1. Create data models to structure the schedule data
2. Add endpoints for processing and analyzing schedules
3. Implement database storage for processed data
4. Create a frontend to visualize the data
