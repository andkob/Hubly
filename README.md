## ðŸš§ Getting Started
***Note:** This project is currently in development. Please follow the instructions below only if you are interested in building on it or trying out the existing features.*

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 21
- Maven
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andkob/Planly.git
cd Planly
```

2. Configure JWT Secret
*This is a temporary solution for development only*
* If you're on Linux or macOS, you can generate a random secret key with the following command:
    ```bash
    openssl rand -base64 32
    ```
    Or if you're on Windows, you can use the provided powershell script located in the root directory:
    ```bash
    powershell -File jwt-secret-generator.ps1
    ```
* Copy the generated secret and add the following line to the **application.properties** file
```properties
# Add this to src/main/resources/application.properties
jwt.secret=YourGeneratedSecretKey
```

3. Create a self-signed SSL certificate (for development only)
```bash
keytool -genkeypair -alias your_key_alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore keystore.p12 -validity 365

# You will be prompted for:
# - Keystore password (remember this for application.properties)
# - Your name and organizational details (can use defaults for development)
# - Confirmation of the details
```
Place the generated keystore.p12 file in the project's src/main/resources directory.

4. Add SSL configuration to application.properties
```properties
# SSL Configuration
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
server.ssl.key-alias=your_key_alias
server.port=8443

# Add this line with your keystore password
server.ssl.key-store-password=your_keystore_password
```

5. Build and Run Backend
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

6. Create a .env file in the React root (src/main/webapp/frontend) with the following content:
```bash
# Create .env in src/main/webapp/frontend/.env
HTTPS=true
# Assuming mkcert files are in the frontend directory:
SSL_CRT_FILE=./localhost.pem
SSL_KEY_FILE=./localhost-key.pem
```
For development, you can generate these certificates using mkcert
```bash
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost
```
This will generate localhost.pem and localhost-key.pem files. Ensure the paths match those in your .env file.

7. Install and Run the React Development Server
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
8. Access the application at https://localhost:3000

9. Verify Installation
- Backend should be running on https://localhost:8443
- Frontend should be running on https://localhost:3000
- You should see the login page when accessing the frontend URL
- Your browser might warn about self-signed certificates (this is normal in development)

### Common Issues
1. Certificate errors in browser
   - This is expected with self-signed certificates
   - Click "Advanced" and proceed to the website

2. Frontend can't connect to backend
   - Ensure backend is running on port 8443
   - Check that all SSL configurations match
   - Verify proxy setting in package.json points to https://localhost:8443

3. CORS errors
   - Verify SecurityConfig.java has correct CORS settings
   - Check that frontend URL matches allowed origins in CORS configuration

## ðŸ”œ Upcoming Features
- Google OAuth 2.0 integration
- Google Calendar synchronization
- GroupMe synchronization
- Enhanced event management tools
- Mobile application
