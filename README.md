# Planly

Planly is a sophisticated web application engineered to streamline schedule coordination and event management within organizations. The platform serves as a centralized hub where organization members can share their availability, plan events, and manage group activities efficiently. With features like availability visualization and real-time schedule management, Planly simplifies the complexity of group coordination.

### Key Features
- Interactive visuals for easy event planning
- Real-time event management and coordination
- Organization-wide calendar integration
- Role-based access control and member management
- Secure authentication and data protection
- Intuitive, responsive user interface built with React
- Robust backend architecture using Spring Boot

## Personal Note:
What began as a practical solution to address scheduling challenges within my fraternity transformed into an invaluable learning experience in modern web application development. This project embodies the journey from identifying a real-world problem to implementing a comprehensive technical solution.
The evolution of Planly from a simple coordination tool to a full-featured platform reflects both my growth as a developer and my understanding of organizational dynamics.

This project stands as a testament to how personal challenges can inspire technical solutions that benefit broader communities. What started as a way to solve our fraternity's disorganization has grown into a robust platform that could help any organization better manage their collective time and activities.

*Transforming group chaos into coordinated harmony, one schedule at a time.*

## ðŸš§ Getting Started
***Note:** This project is currently in development (many security vulnerabilities have not yet been addressed). Please follow the instructions below only if you are interested in building on it or trying out the existing features.*

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 21
- Maven
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andkob/Planly.git
cd Planly
```
2. Configure JWT Secret
*This is a temporary solution for development only*
* If you're on Linux or macOS, you can generate a random secret key with the following command:
    ```bash
    $ openssl rand -base64 32
    ```
    Or if you're on Windows, you can use the provided powershell script located in the root directory:
    ```bash
    $ powershell -File jwt-secret-generator.ps1
    ```
* Copy the generated secret and hardcode it into the **application.properties** file (located in resources)
```properties
jwt.secret=YourSuperSecretKeyThatIsHardToGuess
```
3. Build and Run Backend
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
4. Install and Run the React Development Server
```bash
cd src/main/webapp/frontend
npm install
npm start
```
5. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
